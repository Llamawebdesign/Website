   <h1 class="title">Terms and Conditions</h1>
   <p>Llama Web Design terms and conditions of service. Last Modified: August 29th 2022.</p>
   <p>Please read these terms and conditions carefully. They cover the full list of services provided by Llama Web Design.</p>
   <br />

    <p><b>1. Acceptance</b></p>
    <p>It is not necessary for any Client to have signed an acceptance of these terms and conditions for them to apply. If a Client accepts a quote then the Client will be deemed to have satisfied themselves as to the terms applying and have accepted these terms and conditions in full. Please read these terms and conditions carefully. Any purchase or use of our services implies that you have read and accepted our terms and conditions.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>2. Charges</b></p>
    <p>Charges for services provided by Llama Web Design are defined on our home-page under pricing. <a href="https://llamawebdesign.co.uk#pricing" target="_blank">Pricing can be found here</a>. We reserve the right to adjust our pricing as we see fit, however any client that has already been accepted via email will be charged at the older, agreed-upon rate.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>3. Client Review</b></p>
    <p>Llama Web Design will provide multiple opportunities for the client to review the appearance and content of the website during the design and development phase. We will provide website mockups created on Google Slides to show the client a rough idea of how the website will be designed and laid out.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>4. Search Engine Optimisation</b></p>
    <p>Under no guarentee can we say that the search engine optimisation services we provide will guarentee that your website is ranked more favourably on search results.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>5. Uptime and third-party services</b></p>
    <p>There is no guarentee that the third party services we utilise for Domain Registration, Email Servers and Website Servers will have a 100% guarenteed uptime.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>6. Payment</b></p>
    <p>Invoices are typically sent via email with a link to our payment processor, <a href="https://stripe.com/gb?utm_campaign=paid_brand-UK_en_Search_Brand_Stripe-2032860449&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&ad_content=604272871169&utm_term=stripe&utm_matchtype=e&utm_adposition=&utm_device=c" target="_blank">Stripe</a>. Clients will be invoiced immediately after the work has been completed. Once the invoice has been paid, the website's source code will either: <br> A. Be handed over to the client for them to host themselves. <br> B. If the client has purchased a domain name and hosting from us, their website will be put online. <br><br> If the invoice is not paid within 7 days, we will add a 5% non-payment fee, and then send a second and final invoice. If our final invoice has not been paid, then we will remove all source code written for the client.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>6.1. Re-occuring payments</b></p>
    <p>A client will be invoiced for their re-occuring payments (such as Website Hosting, Domains or SSL Certificates), two weeks before it is renewed. If the client has not paid within 11 days from the invoice being sent, their service will be terminated.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>7. Web Browsers</b></p>
    <p>Llama Web Design makes every effort to ensure websites are designed to be viewed by the majority of visitors. Our websites are designed to work with the most popular browsers. Despite this we take no guarentee that our websites will work on newer versions of Web Browsers released after the website was designed, or deprecated Web Browsers which are no-longer being updated (such as Internet Explorer). Llama Web Design reserves the right to quote for any work involved in changing the website design or the website code for it to work with updated browser software.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>8. Website Updates</b></p>
    <p>If a client requires an update for the website, they reserve the right to either choose us or another person/company to do the updates required. We will give an exact quote based on the amount of works required using estimates from our pricing section on our homepage.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>9. Termination</b></p>
    <p>Termination of services by the Client must be requested in a written notice via email. If the client has already purchased services from us such as Website Design and Hosting, and their website is online, then the client will have their website taken down. If we are in the process of designing their website, then they will not be invoiced.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>10. Use of service</b></p>
    <p>Llama Web Design holds the right to refuse service to any potential client. You may not use the service for reasons including (but not limited to): Sale or discussion of drugs or prohibited items according to United Kingdom and local legislation. Prostitution, Sale of explicit items or Pornography. Hate speech or radical groups. </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>11. Liability</b></p>

    <p>&bull; Loss or damage caused by any innacuracy;</p>
    <p>&bull; Loss or damage caused by omission;</p>
